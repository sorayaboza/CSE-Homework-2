\section*{Knowledge Representation}
% Translating the sentences into propositional logic.

\textbf{It is not cloudy and it is not raining.}\\
Let p = "It is not cloudy", and let q = "It is raining", then: \\
$\lnot p \to \lnot p$\\\\
\textbf{I like to eat apples and bananas.}\\
Let p = "I like to eat apples", and let q = "I like to eat bananas", then:\\
$p \to q $\\\\
\textbf{Behind the clouds the sun is shining.}\\
Let p = "Behind the clouds", and let q = "The sun is shining", then:\\
pq\\\\
\textbf{If a function is differentiable then the function is continuous.}\\
Let p = "A function is differentiable", and let q = "The function is continuous", then:\\
(p \to q)\\\\
\textbf{I will study for the final otherwise I will fail.}\\
Let p = "I will study for the final", and let q = "I will fail", then:\\
p \lor q

\section*{Equivalence in Propositional Logic}
% Determining whether the following pairs of propositions are equivalent to each other.  If they are not equivalent, explain why. If they are equivalent, provide a proof.

% One
$p\land q\
and\
p \lor  \lnot q$\\
\textbf{These two are not equivalent because they don't match in truth tables.}\\\\
% Two
$p\lor q\
and\
\lnot p \lor  \lnot q$\\\\
\textbf{These two are not equivalent.}\\\\
% Three
$p \to q\
and\
\lnot p \to  \lnot q$\\\\
\textbf{These two are not equivalent.}\\\\
% Four
$p \to q\
and\
\lnot p \lor q$\\\\
\textbf{These two are equivalent.}\\\\
% Five
$\lnot (p\land q)\
and\
\lnot p \lor  \lnot q$\\\\
\textbf{These two are not equivalent.}\\\\
